            There's more data that being a coffee drinker can be good for your health.

            Downing up to three cups of coffee daily is associated with lower risks for stroke and death from
            cardiovascular disease, as well as death from all causes, suggests research presented at the European
            Society of Cardiology Congress in France last week.

            “Our results suggest that regular coffee consumption is safe, as even high daily intake was not associated
            with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality after a follow-up of 10 to 15 years,” said
            study author Dr. Judit Simon of the Heart and Vascular Centre, Semmelweis University, in Budapest, Hungary,
            in a news release about the research. The study, yet to be peer-reviewed, was selected for presentation by
            the ESC program committee.

        <h1>Refresh and drive </h1>
        <p>
            Drowsy driving is an important cause of traffic accidents , and therefore, the development of effective
            countermeasures is essential. Consuming a cup of
            coffee is one of the most commonly used ways to combat driver sleepiness. An estimated 80% of the population
            consumes caffeine-containing beverages, often on a daily basis
            Caffeine is rapidly and completely absorbed in the body within approximately 45
            min (Blanchard and Sawers 1983). It reaches its peak plasma concentration within 15 to 120 min after intake
            , averaging around 30 min. Its
            elimination half life is 1.5 to 9.5 h . Although additional mechanisms of
            action are involved, it is now believed that caffeine’s stimulant effects are exerted by antagonizing
            adenosine, primarily by blocking the adenosine A1 and A2A receptors. Adenosine is considered to be a
            mediator of sleep

            <b>Indonesia - Robusta & Arabica</b><br>
            Indonesia, which we frequently hear associated with interesting coffee types, produces 660,000,000 kg of
            coffee per year. Although quality and taste pale in comparison to Brazil and Colombia, it has an important
            place in global coffee production.
        </p>
        <p>

            <b>Brazil - Arabica</b>
            As you know, Brazil is one of the top coffee producing countries. In Brazil, 2,594,100 tons of coffee was
            produced in 2016. Among the reasons for the coffee grown in Brazil being so tasty are the wide production
            areas and the premium quality of the product. The coffee produced in Brazil is often preferred because it
            has low acidity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>India - Arabica & Robusta</b>

            Arabica and Robusta coffee beans are grown abundantly in India. The much renowned coffee beans grown in the
            south region of the country are known for their soft taste and high levels of acidity.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Colombia - Arabica</b>

            Colombia, which claims a fair share of coffee production with 810,000,000 kg per year, is just behind Brazil
            in terms of taste with its Arabica coffee bean. Among the delicious coffee types of Colombia are Extra and
            Supremo.
